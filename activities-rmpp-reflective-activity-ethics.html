										<h3 class="major">Unit 1: Ethics in Computing in the age of Generative AI</h3>
										
										 <p>The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has fundamentally changed our world, from chatbots to self-driving cars, AI is reshaping industries, societies, 
										and individual lives in ways we have never imagined. As AI becomes more powerful, ethical and governance concerns continue to grow. The key questions we must ask are:</p>
										<ol>
										<li>How do we ensure AI serves humanity?</li>
										<li>How can we create fair systems when nations have such diverse priorities?</li>
										<li>What responsibilities do computing professionals have in this rapidly evolving landscape?</li>
										</ol>
										
										<p>I remember watching The Imitation Game (2014), a historical drama based on Alan Turing's biography, Alan Turing: The Enigma (1983) by Andrew Hodges. Turing (1912–1954), 
										a British mathematician and cryptanalyst, was instrumental in breaking the Nazi Enigma code during World War II. Beyond his wartime achievements, he is regarded as the father 
										of modern computer science and a pioneer of artificial intelligence. Turing believed in the potential of AI, though many of his contemporaries dismissed the idea that machines 
										could "think." Critics, like John Searle, an American philosopher who later proposed the Chinese Room Argument, argued that AI would never understand or possess consciousness (Searle, 1980).</p>
										<p>In this reflection, I explore how different countries regulate AI and the challenges of forming universal governance. While there is no single "right answer," one thing is 
										clear is that thoughtful and proactive governance is essential to guide AI toward a future that benefits all.</p>

										<p><b>How Different Countries Regulate AI</b></p>										
										<p>AI regulation is not universal, each country approaches AI governance differently based on its values, economy, and political system. Certain countries implement rigorous, law-based 
										frameworks, whereas others opt for industry self-regulation.</p>
										
										<p>In Europe, AI regulation is highly structured. The EU AI Act categorises AI into different risk levels, banning AI applications that pose an “unacceptable risk” such as social scoring, 
										while strictly monitoring high-risk applications like biometric surveillance (European Commission, 2021). The EU has long been a leader in data protection, and the General Data Protection 
										Regulation (GDPR) has set global standards for privacy and AI governance (European Parliament and Council, 2016).</p>

										<p>On the other hand, the United States takes a sectoral approach, regulating AI based on industry rather than a universal framework (U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2021). A huge portion 
										of AI governance in the country depends on self-regulation by companies (White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, 2022). This approach allows rapid innovation but can lead to ethical 
										issues when companies prioritise profits over fairness (Fjeld et al., 2020).</p>
											
										<p>Meanwhile, China has one of the most controlled AI environments. AI is regulated under strict state oversight, with AI-driven surveillance and social credit scoring deeply embedded into governance. 
										AI companies must follow strict data localisation laws, ensuring the government has full control over AI applications.</p>

										<p>Other countries like Canada, Japan and the UK take different approaches. Canada’s Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIA) focuses on transparency in government AI use, while Japan promotes human-centric 
										AI that aligns with societal values. The UK takes a "pro-innovation" approach, promoting ethical AI development without heavy legal restrictions.</p>

										<p>In these examples, AI regulation reflect national priorities. While the EU and China see AI governance as a matter of public safety and ethics, the U.S. and UK emphasise flexibility and innovation. 
										The challenge is finding common ground to ensure global AI development is both ethical and effective.</p>

										<p><b>The challenges in forming Universal AI Governance Principles</b></p>

										<p>Given the diverse ways countries regulate AI, it is no surprise that forming a universal set of AI governance principles is extremely difficult. The Correa et al. (2023) study, which reviewed over 
										200 AI governance documents worldwide, highlighted several major barriers to global AI consensus.</p>

										<p>Cultural and political differences</p>
										<p>One of the biggest hurdles to universal AI governance is political and cultural diversity. The EU’s AI Act reflects European values of privacy, transparency, and human rights, while China’s approach aligns 
										with its state-controlled, surveillance-driven governance model. The U.S., in contrast, resists heavy regulation in favour of economic competitiveness.
										How can we create global AI rules when different societies have conflicting views on privacy, surveillance, and autonomy? Like for example, in Western democracies, privacy is a fundamental right, while in 
										China, AI-driven mass surveillance is considered essential for national security. These differences make global AI governance incredibly complex.</p>

										<p>Lack of a standardised legal framework</p>
										<p>AI governance is still in its early stages, and different countries take vastly different legal approaches. Certain countries implement hard laws, which are legally binding rules, whereas others depend on soft 
										laws such as guidelines and recommendations. Without a unified framework, AI companies face regulatory uncertainty, especially when operating across multiple countries.
										For instance, an AI system approved in the U.S. may not be compliant with European laws, leading to legal conflicts and business challenges. This inconsistency makes it difficult to create AI systems that are both 
										ethical and globally compliant.</p>

										<p>Defining and Enforcing AI Ethics</p>
										<p>Even when ethical AI principles are agreed upon, enforcing them is another challenge. Many AI ethics guidelines stress fairness, transparency, and accountability. However, defining what fairness means in AI is 
										not always straightforward. For example,</p>
										<ol>
										<li>Should AI hiring systems be trained to ignore race entirely?</li>
										<li>Should they actively compensate for past discrimination?</li>
										<li>Should AI models be transparent if making them explainable means revealing trade secrets?</li>
										</ol>

										<p>These ethical dilemmas complicate AI governance, especially when diverse cultures have different perspectives on fairness and justice.</p>
										
										<p>The rapid pace of AI advancements - Another major challenge is that AI technology evolves faster than laws can keep up. Governments are still debating regulations for traditional AI, while Generative AI such as ChatGPT and DALL·E is already 
										creating new ethical and legal dilemmas. By the time policymakers agree on AI regulations, the technology may have already moved several steps ahead. This rapid evolution makes AI governance an ongoing process 
										rather than a one-time solution.</p>

										<p>Implications for Computing Professionals - As a computing professional, these discussions on AI ethics and governance have profound implications for my work. As engineers, developers, and data scientists we are not just creating technology, we are 
										shaping the future of society.</p>

										<p>Responsibility and accountability - One of the biggest takeaways from my research is that computing professionals must be accountable for AI’s impact. AI can be biased, discriminatory, or even dangerous if not carefully designed. We must 
										therefore prioritise ethical design over profit-driven development.</p>

										<p>Transparency and Explainability - Another criticism of AI is the black box problem, many AI systems are so complex that even their creators do not fully understand how they make decisions.</p>

										<p>Ethical AI Design - Consider data privacy, fairness, and bias mitigation throughout development. When working on an AI project we should ask:</p>
										<ol>
										<li>Does this AI system respect user privacy?</li>
										<li>Is it fair and unbiased?</li>
										<li>Does it create more harm than good?</li>
										<li>Would I trust this AI system if I were affected by it?</li>
										</ol>

										<p>Legal and professional compliance</p>
										<p>AI developers must stay informed on AI laws and regulations, ensuring that the systems they build comply with local and international standards. This requires collaborating with policymakers, 
										ethicists, and legal experts to ensure AI is used responsibly.</p>

										<p>Conclusion</p>
										<p>As AI is one of the most powerful technologies of our time, its ethical implications cannot be ignored. We must educate users that different countries regulate AI in vastly different ways, 
										making universal AI governance a complex challenge. AI ethics is not just about policy and law it is about real-world impact. Whether I am developing AI models, designing algorithms, or 
										analysing data, I believe I must constantly question the ethical implications of my work.</p>
