										<h3 class="major">Unit 3 Seminar: Peer Review Activity</h3>
										<p>In preparation for this week’s seminar, you will need to source at least 2 papers in a Computing subject of your choice (AI, Cybersecurity, Data Science, 
										or a general interest topic in Computer Science) provided they utilise two different types of research methods to achieve their goal/research aims. Now answer 
										the following questions (please provide justifications for your answers) and be prepared to discuss them in the session:</p>
										<ul>
										<li>Familiarise yourself with the purpose, problem, objective or research question of each paper. Are they in line with your experience or thoughts on the topic, 
										contributing to the collective body of knowledge in this area</li>
										<li>Is the research methodology utilised in each paper appropriate for the stated purpose or question?</li>
										<li>In terms of data collection and analysis, is this also appropriate for the stated purpose or question? (We will discuss this further in upcoming units.)</li>
										<li>Does each paper support its claims and conclusions with explicit arguments or evidence?</li>
										<li>How would you enhance the work/paper?
										</ul>
										<p>I've reviewed the two following literature review papers</p>
										<p>"A Literature Review of Cyber Security" (Goel, 2019) and "Internet of Things (IoT) Cybersecurity: Literature Review and IoT Cyber Risk Management" (Lee, 2020)</p>
										<p><strong>Purpose, Problem, and Research Question</strong></p>
										<p>The first paper, A Literature Review of Cyber Security (Goel, 2019), aims to clarify the distinction between cybersecurity and information security, arguing that 
										cybersecurity encompasses a broader scope that includes human factors, societal risks, and ethical considerations.</p>
										<p>The research problem identified is that traditional information security models focus primarily on data protection, neglecting the impact of cybersecurity on 
										individuals and organisations. The objective is to provide a theoretical expansion of cybersecurity, illustrating its significance beyond conventional frameworks. 
										The primary research question explores how cybersecurity differs from information security and what other factors need to be taken into account. </p>
										
										<p>The second paper, Internet of Things (IoT) Cybersecurity: Literature Review and IoT Cyber Risk Management (Lee, 2020), focuses on cybersecurity risks associated 
										with IoT systems, addressing the lack of a structured risk management framework for IoT security. The research problem highlights that existing cybersecurity risk 
										assessment models are inadequate for the dynamic nature of IoT networks. The objective of the study is to review IoT cybersecurity technologies, propose a four-layer 
										IoT cyber risk management framework and introduce a linear programming model to optimise cybersecurity investment allocation. The research questions include: How 
										can IoT cybersecurity risks be effectively managed? What frameworks exist for IoT cybersecurity, and how can they be improved?</p>

										<p><strong>Research Methodology: Appropriateness and Limitations</strong></p>
										<p>Both papers employ a literature review methodology, combining academic and industry research to understand cybersecurity problems.</p>
										<ul>
										<li>Goel (2019) adopts a qualitative, theoretical approach, critically evaluating cybersecurity definitions, models, and frameworks. This methodology is appropriate for 
										conceptual analysis but lacks empirical validation. The study could have been strengthened by incorporating case studies or survey data to assess how cybersecurity 
										frameworks are applied in practice.</li>

										<li>Lee (2020) employs a systematic literature review to analyse IoT cybersecurity threats and risk management strategies, followed by a conceptual framework development. 
										While the structured literature review is appropriate for identifying gaps in cybersecurity risk assessment, the proposed four-layer IoT cyber risk management framework 
										and the linear programming model remains theoretical. Without empirical validation, the effectiveness of these models in real-world IoT environments is uncertain.</li>
										</ul>

										<p><strong>Data Collection and Analysis: Strengths and Weaknesses</strong></p>
										<p>Both papers rely on secondary data sources, primarily academic research, industry reports, and cybersecurity frameworks.</p>
										<ul>
										<li>Goel (2019) utilises qualitative synthesis, analysing various cybersecurity definitions and frameworks to argue for a broader 
										understanding of cybersecurity. However, the study lacks quantitative analysis, empirical data, or case studies, which limits its 
										applicability to real-world scenarios.</li>
										<li>Lee (2020) employs a structured literature review and conceptual modelling. The paper categorises IoT security risks by architectural 
										layers and proposes a quantitative linear programming model for cybersecurity investment. However, the model is not tested with 
										real-world data, making its practical applicability uncertain.</li>

										<p><strong>Support for Claims and Conclusions</strong></p>
										<p>The strength of argumentation and evidence in each paper varies.</p>
										<ul>
										<li>Goel(2019) presents a logical, well-structured argument for redefining cybersecurity beyond traditional information security. The paper is strong 
										conceptually but does not provide empirical evidence to validate its claims. The conclusion is justified but remains theoretical.</li>
										<li>Lee (2020) builds a structured argument on IoT security risks and the need for a dedicated risk management framework. The literature review supports 
										the claims, but the proposed models are not empirically tested, making the conclusion less conclusive than they could be.</li>

										<p><strong>Enhancing both these papers</strong>:</p>
										<p>Both papers can be enhanced by incorporating empirical research, real-world case studies, and comparative analysis of cybersecurity frameworks.</p>

										<li>Goel (2019) could be improved by:</li>
										<p>Incorporating real-world cybersecurity case studies and statistical data on cybercrime trends.</p>
										<p>Expanding the discussion on cybersecurity implementation in various industries.</p>										
										<p>Comparing NIST, ISO 27001, and GDPR frameworks for a more comprehensive evaluation.</p>										
										<p>Providing recommendations for policy improvements and future research directions.</p>											
										
										<li>Lee (2020) could be improved by:</li>
										<p>Empirically testing the four-layer IoT cybersecurity risk management framework using case studies from IoT industries.</p>
										<p>Applying real-world cybersecurity budget data to validate the linear programming model.</p>
										<p>Expanding the discussion on regulatory and compliance challenges for IoT cybersecurity</p>
										<p>Providing comparative analysis of global IoT security regulations (e.g., EU GDPR, US NIST guidelines, China’s cybersecurity laws).</p>

										<p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p>
										<p>Both papers contribute valuable insights into cybersecurity and IoT risk management. However, their primary limitation is the lack of 
										empirical validation. Goel (2019) presents a strong conceptual analysis but would benefit from real-world case studies and policy comparisons. 
										Lee (2020) proposes a structured IoT cybersecurity framework, but without empirical testing, its practical applicability remains theoretical. 
										Incorporating real-world cybersecurity incidents, comparative regulatory analysis, and industry-specific case studies would significantly 
										enhance the impact and validity of both studies.</p> 
										
										<p>By addressing these limitations and enhancements, both papers could provide stronger, more actionable insights for academia, policymakers, and industry professionals.</p>
