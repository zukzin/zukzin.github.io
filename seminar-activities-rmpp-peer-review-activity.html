										<h3 class="major">Unit 3 Seminar: Peer Review Activity</h3>
										<p>In preparation for this week’s seminar, you will need to source at least 2 papers in a Computing subject of your choice (AI, Cybersecurity, Data Science, 
										or a general interest topic in Computer Science) provided they utilise two different types of research methods to achieve their goal/research aims. Now answer 
										the following questions (please provide justifications for your answers) and be prepared to discuss them in the session:</p>
										<ul>
										<li>Familiarise yourself with the purpose, problem, objective or research question of each paper. Are they in line with your experience or thoughts on the topic, 
										contributing to the collective body of knowledge in this area</li>
										<li>Is the research methodology utilised in each paper appropriate for the stated purpose or question?</li>
										<li>In terms of data collection and analysis, is this also appropriate for the stated purpose or question? (We will discuss this further in upcoming units.)</li>
										<li>Does each paper support its claims and conclusions with explicit arguments or evidence?</li>
										<li>How would you enhance the work/paper?
										</ul>
										<p>I've reviewed the two following literature review papers</p>
										<p>"A Literature Review of Cyber Security" (Goel, 2019) and "Internet of Things (IoT) Cybersecurity: Literature Review and IoT Cyber Risk Management" (Lee, 2020)</p>
										<p><strong>Purpose, Problem, and Research Question</strong></p>
										<p>The first paper, A Literature Review of Cyber Security (Goel, 2019), aims to clarify the distinction between cybersecurity and information security, arguing that 
										cybersecurity encompasses a broader scope that includes human factors, societal risks, and ethical considerations.</p>
										<p>The research problem identified is that traditional information security models focus primarily on data protection, neglecting the impact of cybersecurity on 
										individuals and organisations. The objective is to provide a theoretical expansion of cybersecurity, illustrating its significance beyond conventional frameworks. 
										The primary research question explores how cybersecurity differs from information security and what other factors need to be taken into account. </p>
										
										<p>The second paper, Internet of Things (IoT) Cybersecurity: Literature Review and IoT Cyber Risk Management (Lee, 2020), focuses on cybersecurity risks associated 
										with IoT systems, addressing the lack of a structured risk management framework for IoT security. The research problem highlights that existing cybersecurity risk 
										assessment models are inadequate for the dynamic nature of IoT networks. The objective of the study is to review IoT cybersecurity technologies, propose a four-layer 
										IoT cyber risk management framework and introduce a linear programming model to optimise cybersecurity investment allocation. The research questions include: How 
										can IoT cybersecurity risks be effectively managed? What frameworks exist for IoT cybersecurity, and how can they be improved?</p>

										<p><strong>Research Methodology: Appropriateness and Limitations</strong></p>
										<p>Both papers employ a literature review methodology, combining academic and industry research to understand cybersecurity problems.</p>
										<ul>
										<li>Goel (2019) adopts a qualitative, theoretical approach, critically evaluating cybersecurity definitions, models, and frameworks. This methodology is appropriate for 
										conceptual analysis but lacks empirical validation. The study could have been strengthened by incorporating case studies or survey data to assess how cybersecurity 
										frameworks are applied in practice.</li>

										<li>Lee (2020) employs a systematic literature review to analyse IoT cybersecurity threats and risk management strategies, followed by a conceptual framework development. 
										While the structured literature review is appropriate for identifying gaps in cybersecurity risk assessment, the proposed four-layer IoT cyber risk management framework 
										and the linear programming model remains theoretical. Without empirical validation, the effectiveness of these models in real-world IoT environments is uncertain.</li>
										</ul>

										<p>Question 2:</p>
										<p>Some say that people are the biggest risk of cyber security. Select five terms from ISO/IEC Standard 27000 Section 3 Terms and Definitions 
										and write a 300-word blog post on how people can be managed to overcome cyber security attacks from the inside.</p> 
										
										<p><b>Managing People to Overcome Insider Cybersecurity Threats</b></p>
										<p>Cybersecurity risks often emerge from within organizations due to human actions or errors, whether intentional or accidental. The five key terms identified from ISO/IEC 27000's Section 3 are; access control, authentication, confidentiality, risk management, and vulnerability which provide a framework for understanding and managing these risks (ISO/IEC, 2018).</p>
										
										<ol>
										<li>Access control (ISO/IEC, 2018, 3.1)</li>
										<p>Ensures that access to sensitive assets is restricted based on business needs and security requirements. I order to mitigate insider threats, organizations must implement stringent access control policies, limiting data access strictly to authorised personnel. Regular audits can further ensure adherence to these controls, helping maintain organizational security (ISO/IEC, 2018, 3.3).</p>

										<li>Authentication (ISO/IEC, 2018, 3.5)</li>
										<p>This is the process of verifying an individual’s claimed identity, forming a critical barrier against unauthorised access. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) reinforces this measure by requiring additional verification steps, making unauthorised access more challenging and helping prevent internal breaches.</p>

										<li>Confidentiality (ISO/IEC, 2018, 3.10)</li>
										<p>This involves safeguarding information from disclosure to unauthorised parties. Organizations should foster a culture of confidentiality by training employees on data sensitivity and the importance of secure information handling practices. Employees should be aware of potential consequences if confidentiality is compromised, thereby ensuring a safer information environment.</p>
										
										<li>Risk management (ISO/IEC, 2018, 3.69)</li>
										<p>The process coordinates organizational efforts to identify, analyse, and control risks. This means employees are integral to this process; through training, they become aware of common cyber threats and internal policies, enabling them to recognise and respond appropriately to potential incidents.</p>
										
										<li>Vulnerability (ISO/IEC, 2018, 3.77)</li>
										<p>Were weaknesses in assets or controls may present exploitable opportunities for threats. By promoting a proactive approach to identifying vulnerabilities, organizations can engage employees in early detection and reporting. This collaborative vigilance helps to address weaknesses before external actors can exploit them.</p>
										</ol>
										
										<p>Managing people effectively through awareness, access limitations, and clear confidentiality practices can significantly reduce cybersecurity risks from within. An informed and accountable workforce enhances an organization’s resilience against both internal and external threats.</p>
