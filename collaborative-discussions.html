										<h4>Contributions by Zukiswa Tuso</h4>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/1.png" alt="" /></span>I have worked in various companies across the UK, primarily focusing on large and small organizations managed both locally and globally. While my direct experience hasn’t been in IT, I have been involved in CRM software project implementations in many of these organizations. These implementations aimed to streamline customer management processes and improve efficiency.
										However, implementing these software systems often proves challenging. My first-hand experience has shown that improper implementation, lack of user training, and system complexities frequently lead to software project failures. The most common issues I have encountered include data migration challenges, integration problems, and user adoption hurdles.
										For example, one sales staff member resigned when the business migrated from a manual system to Salesforce. He refused to accept the migration, stating, “I’m a salesperson, and I don’t want to be bogged down with entering data or learning a new skill on top of making sales.” His resignation led to a domino effect, with many salespeople leaving the company due to similar frustrations. This is not an isolated incident; it’s a common scenario in organizations attempting to improve efficiency. In 2013, Avon Products had to abandon a $125 million SAP CRM System powered by Salesforce after facing significant implementation issues. The system was too complex for sales representatives to use effectively, leading to a drop in sales and morale among the sales force (Bloomberg News, 2013).
										In another organization I worked for, a similar scenario unfolded. This was their second attempt at implementing a new CRM system after the first one failed due to user difficulties, akin to Avon’s experience with Salesforce. Despite hiring more salespeople, the project team struggled to train new members effectively. The data was disorganized, and ongoing issues during training sessions caused frustration. Ultimately, the company decided to switch to another CRM software, HubSpot. The project was scheduled for six months, but after this period, a new executive was hired, firing most of the sales team and contractors.</p>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>Based on these insights, I believe the main issues contributing to software project failures are:
										<h4>Organization and Planning-Related Failures:</h4>
												<ol>
													<li>Scheduling Issues:</li>
														<p>Unrealistic schedules, management cancelling meetings, lack of accountability, and insufficient technical understanding can derail projects. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Advanced Automation System project faced extensive delays and budget overruns due to poor scheduling and procurement planning (Bar-Yam, 2003)</p> .
													<li>Implementing Significant Changes All at Once:</li>
													 	<p>This approach often leads to delays, budget overruns, and incomplete implementation. Different roles consume information differently, so breaking projects into smaller, manageable components is crucial.</p>
													<li>Managing the Project-Related Failures:</li>											
														<p>Lack of Cooperation: Poor communication and collaboration among team members and stakeholders lead to misunderstandings, incorrect assumptions, and missed requirements. In one case study, the lack of cooperation between developers and testers resulted in significant defects being discovered late in the project cycle, causing delays and increased costs (Lehtinen et al., 2014).</p>
													<li>Weak Task Backlog:</li>	
													 	<p>Poorly defined tasks, improper prioritization, and insufficient updates lead to inefficiencies and project delays.</p>
													<li>Lack of Software Testing Resources:</li>	
														 <p>Insufficient time, personnel, and proper tools result in lower-quality products and undetected defects.</p>
													<li>Estimation Related Failures:</li>
														<p>Time and Cost Estimation: Inaccurate estimates for project duration and costs lead to significant issues. The Universal Credit system in the UK, designed to streamline welfare benefits, encountered numerous technical problems, delays, and budget overruns.</p>
														<br>Additionally, developers, contractors, and the organization’s sales force often disconnect. Contractors may lack an understanding of the business they are working on, leading to further complications. It’s essential for all parties involved to have a clear understanding of the business and its offerings to ensure successful project outcomes.</br>
