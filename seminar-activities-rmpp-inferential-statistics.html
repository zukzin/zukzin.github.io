										<p>Hypothesis Testing Using Excel - Seminar Preparation: Unit 7</p>
										<ul>
										<li><strong>The Related Samples T Test</strong></li>
										<p>In Exercise 7.1, a one-tailed paired samples t-test was conducted to determine whether Filter Agent 1 was more effective at 
										reducing impurities compared to Filter Agent 2. Based on the results, the calculated t-statistic was -3.264 with 11 degrees of 
										freedom and the corresponding one-tailed p-value was 0.0038. Since the p-value is significantly less than the 5% significance 
										level (p < 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis. This provides strong statistical evidence that Filter Agent 1 is more effective 
										than Filter Agent 2 in reducing impurities. Therefore, had a one-tailed test been conducted, we would have confidently concluded 
										that Filter Agent 1 performs better in impurity removal. Please refer to the attached supporting documentation</p>									
										<p><strong>Paired t-Test Agent1 vs Agent2 </strong><a href="https://github.com/zukzin/zukzin.github.io/raw/27264acce90fb372c36a9ff76b52d295d76785a3/images/Paired%20tTest%20Agent1%20vs%20Agent2.xlsx" download> Download Excel Spreadsheet-Paired t-Test Agent1 vs Agent2</a></p>

										<li><strong>The INDEPENDENT Samples T Test</strong></li>
										<p>In Exercise 7.2, the requirement is to test whether the population mean income for males exceeds that of females and interpret it. It also asks to mention assumptions and how to validate them.	
										<p>To answer the question, an independent samples t-test of two-sample t-test assuming unequal variances was performed link here <a href="https://github.com/zukzin/zukzin.github.io/raw/8bc2c089393acafeaf0820f38639791e238c9a59/images/two-sample%20t-test%20assuming%20unequal%20variances.xlsx" download>see here</a>, 
										(Note: Excel doesn’t print H₀) to determine whether the population mean income for males exceeds that of females. 
										Prior to the t-test, an F-test 1.203 with a two-tailed p-value of 0.432, indicating that the assumption of equal 
										population variances was reasonable. Subsequently, a two-sample t-test assuming unequal variances was performed. 
										The test yielded a t-statistic of 1.926 with a one-tailed p-value of 0.056. Since the p-value is greater than the 5% significance level, 
										we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the mean income for male cardholders is greater than that for female cardholders.</p>

										<p>The validity of this analysis depends on the assumptions that the samples are independent, the incomes are approximately normally distributed within each group, 
										and the income variances are comparable, as confirmed by the F-test. To further validate the normality assumption, graphical methods such as histograms or normal probability plots 
									        (Q-Q plots) could be employed, or formal tests such as the Shapiro-Wilk test could be conducted.</p>

										<p>Hypothesis Testing Using Libre Office- Seminar Preparation: Unit 7</p>
										<ul>
										<li><strong>The Related Samples T Test</strong></li>
										<p>In Exercise 7.3, a two-tailed paired samples t-test <a href="https://github.com/zukzin/zukzin.github.io/raw/0c142b1a40026304a6dea8ccde4783964661192d/images/two-tailed%20paired%20samples%20t-test.xlsx" download>see here</a> was conducted to determine whether the population mean impurity differs between two filtration agents, Agent 1 and Agent 2. 
										The test produced a t-statistic of -3.264 with 11 degrees of freedom, and the associated two-tailed p-value was 0.0075. Since the p-value is less than the 5% significance level, 
										we reject the null hypothesis. This provides strong statistical evidence that the mean impurity levels differ between the two filtration agents. Moreover, the sample mean impurity 
										for Agent 1 was 8.25 parts per 1000, compared to 8.68 parts per 1000 for Agent 2, suggesting that Agent 1 may be slightly more effective in reducing impurities.</p>
											
										<li><strong>The One-Tailed Test</strong></li>
										<p>In Exercise 7.4, a one-tailed paired samples t-test was considered to determine whether Filter Agent 1 was more effective than Filter Agent 2 in reducing impurities. 
										Based on the results from the earlier two-tailed test, the t-statistic was -3.264 with 11 degrees of freedom, and the two-tailed p-value was 0.0075. By halving the 
										two-tailed p-value, the one-tailed p-value was calculated to be 0.00375. Since this p-value is substantially less than the 5% significance level, we reject the null hypothesis. 
										Therefore, there is strong statistical evidence that Filter Agent 1 results in a lower mean impurity level than Filter Agent 2, indicating that Filter Agent 1 is the more effective option.</p>
