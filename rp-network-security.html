											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/thinking1.png" alt="" /></span>In the aftermath of the Black Screen of Death (BSOD) incident caused by Microsoft on July 19th, 
											which disrupted global IT operations, grounded flights, and stalled healthcare and banking services, this module has become exceptionally relevant to me. This experience 
											has intensified my interest in cybersecurity, although I am still uncertain about whether I want to pursue it as a career. Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the readings 
											and even began watching the series "Mr. Robot" on Netflix, along with other cybersecurity-related content. My awareness and interest in this field have significantly increased.</p> 
											
											<p>When I commenced work on Module 4, I had serious reservations about my ability to complete it, especially after reading Unit 6. Initially, I felt the requirements exceeded my 
											capabilities. However, I decided to persevere and methodically go through the reading list. As with all modules, particularly when the subject matter is new, understanding 
											the terminology, researching definitions, and making sense of the content took considerable time and effort. Finding sources that provided clear explanations and better 
											understanding was a time-consuming process.</p>

											<p>I vividly recall my attempts to download Linux. When I read Leroux's article on the Kali Linux Review, the statement, "If you read the article but skipped the parts 
											containing too much technical jargon, Kali is not for you," made me feel momentarily defeated. I paused for a day or two to reflect on what I had read. Determined 
											to overcome this challenge, I decided to download Kali Linux. After several attempts and some trial and error, I successfully downloaded and installed VirtualBox. 
											This experience boosted my confidence, affirming that I could tackle this task. Finally, when I successfully uploaded VirtualBox and used it with Kali Linux, I was able 
											to perform the scan on my chosen site, <a href="https://34.246.169.176/">https://34.246.169.176/</a>.</p> This accomplishment was a significant milestone in my learning 
											journey, reinforcing my capability to navigate and understand complex cybersecurity tools and concepts.</p>

											<p><b>Kali Linux</b></p>
											<p>Once I uploaded VirtualBox was able to perform the scan for my chosen site. https://34.246.169.176/ which resulted in the following feedback:</p>

											<p><strong>1st Scan (Ping Scan)</strong>1</p>
											<ul>
											<li>Command Used: nmap -sn 34.246.169.176</li>
											<li>Objective: Determine if the host is up and measure inactivity.</li>
											<li>Result:</li
											</ul>
												<ol>
												<li>The host ec2-34-246-169-176.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com is up.</li>
												<li>Latency: 0.051 seconds.</li>
												<li>Conclusion: The target host is responsive and online.</li>
												</ol>
											<p><strong>2nd Scan (SYN Scan)</strong>1</p>
												<ul>
												<li>Command Used: nmap -PS 34.246.169.176</li>
												<li>Objective: Check for open TCP ports.</li>
												<li>Result:</li>
												</ul>
													<ol>
													<li>Host: ec2-34-246-169-176.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com is up with 0.055 seconds latency.</li>
													<li>Ports:</li>
													</ol>
												<ul>
													<li>80/tcp: Open (HTTP)</li>
													<li>443/tcp: Open (HTTPS)</li>
													<li>8080/tcp: Open (HTTP-Proxy)</li>
													<li>8443/tcp: Open (HTTPS-Alt)</li>
													<p>Other Ports: 996 TCP ports are filtered and not responding.</p>
												</ul>
												<p>Conclusion: The host has several critical services running, specifically web-related services (HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP-Proxy), 
												indicating it serves web content or has a web application interface.</p>
												
												<p>One of the critical lessons I have also learned from this module is the importance of preventing reoccurrences of issues related to 
												encryption keys and encrypted databases. Encryption is a fundamental aspect of protecting sensitive data, but it is not foolproof 
												if not managed correctly.</p>

											<p><b>Frequent Password Changes</b></p>
											<p>Another key insight is the necessity of enforcing frequent password changes within to organisations stakeholders. Passwords are the first line 
											of defence against unauthorised access, and static passwords become vulnerable over time. Implementing a policy that requires employees to 
											update their passwords regularly can significantly reduce the risk of password-related breaches (NIST, 2020). Furthermore, educating employees 
											about creating strong, complex passwords and the dangers of password reuse is crucial in strengthening overall security posture.</p>

											<p><b>Enhanced Monitoring Tools and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)</b></p>
											<p>My analysis also highlighted the need for better monitoring tools and the integration of advanced Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). Effective 
											monitoring tools can provide real-time alerts and detailed logs, allowing for the quick detection and response to potential security incidents. 
											Implementing an IPS can further enhance security by proactively identifying and blocking suspicious activities before they can cause harm 
											(Andress and Winterfeld, 2013). These systems are vital for maintaining the integrity of the network and ensuring continuous protection against 
											evolving threats.</p>

											<p><b>Defence Tools like Microsoft Defender for Backend SQL Databases</b></p>
											<p>Utilising defence tools such as Microsoft Defender for backend SQL databases is another critical strategy that emerged from my assessment. These 
											tools offer advanced threat protection by continuously monitoring and analysing database activities for signs of malicious behaviour. By 
											leveraging such technologies, organizations can ensure that their databases are safeguarded against unauthorised access and data breaches, 
											providing an additional layer of security (Leroux, 2020).</p>

											<p><b>Assessing Organizational and Website Weaknesses</b></p>

											<p>A comprehensive understanding of an organization's or website's weaknesses is understanding the fundamentals of network security, the importance 
											of regularly checking for open ports and missing configurations, which can sometimes be easy entry points for attackers.</p>

											<p><b>Firewall Implementation</b></p>
											<p>Ensuring a robust security system is in place is another critical aspect of network security. Firewalls serve as a barrier between internal networks 
											and external threats, filtering out malicious traffic and preventing unauthorised access. My reflection on this part analysis stresses the importance 
											of configuring and maintaining firewalls properly for effective protection (NIST, 2020).</p>

											<p>Through this network security assessment analysis, I have gained valuable insights into the multifaceted approach required to protect an organization’s network. 
											This module has now deepened my understanding of the importance of continuous monitoring, regular updates, and comprehensive network security strategies to 
											safeguard against evolving cyber threats (ISO/IEC, 2018).</p>
