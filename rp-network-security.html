											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/thinking1.png" alt="" /></span>In the aftermath of the Black Screen of Death (BSOD) incident caused by Microsoft on July 19th, 
											which disrupted global IT operations, grounded flights, and stalled healthcare and banking services, this module has become exceptionally relevant to me. This experience 
											has intensified my interest in cybersecurity, although I am still uncertain about whether I want to pursue it as a career. Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the readings 
											and even began watching the series "Mr. Robot" on Netflix, along with other cybersecurity-related content. My awareness and interest in this field have significantly increased.</p> 
											
											<p>When I commenced work on Module 4, I had serious reservations about my ability to complete it, especially after reading Unit 6. Initially, I felt the requirements exceeded my 
											capabilities. However, I decided to persevere and methodically go through the reading list. As with all modules, particularly when the subject matter is new, understanding 
											the terminology, researching definitions, and making sense of the content took considerable time and effort. Finding sources that provided clear explanations and better 
											understanding was a time-consuming process.</p>

											<p>I vividly recall my attempts to download Linux. When I read Leroux's article on the Kali Linux Review, the statement, "If you read the article but skipped the parts 
											containing too much technical jargon, Kali is not for you," made me feel momentarily defeated. I paused for a day or two to reflect on what I had read. Determined 
											to overcome this challenge, I decided to download Kali Linux. After several attempts and some trial and error, I successfully downloaded and installed VirtualBox. 
											This experience boosted my confidence, affirming that I could tackle this task. Finally, when I successfully uploaded VirtualBox and used it with Kali Linux, I was able 
											to perform the scan on my chosen site, <a href="https://34.246.169.176/">https://34.246.169.176/</a>.</p> This accomplishment was a significant milestone in my learning 
											journey, reinforcing my capability to navigate and understand complex cybersecurity tools and concepts.</p>

											<p><b>Kali Linux</b></p>
											<p>Once I uploaded VirtualBox was able to perform the scan for my chosen site. https://34.246.169.176/ which resulted in the following feedback:</p>

											<p><strong>st Scan (Ping Scan)</strong>1</p>
											<ul>
											<li>Command Used: nmap -sn 34.246.169.176</li>
											<li>Objective: Determine if the host is up and measure inactivity.</li>
											<li>Result:</li
											</ul>
												<ol>
												<li>The host ec2-34-246-169-176.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com is up.</li>
												<li>Latency: 0.051 seconds.</li>
												<li>Conclusion: The target host is responsive and online.</li>
												</ol>
											<p>2<strong>1nd Scan (SYN Scan)</strong>1</p>
												<ul>
												<li>Command Used: nmap -PS 34.246.169.176</li>
												<li>Objective: Check for open TCP ports.</li>
												<li>Result:</li
												</ul>
													<ol>
													<li>Host: ec2-34-246-169-176.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com is up with 0.055 seconds latency.</li>
													<li>Ports:</li>
