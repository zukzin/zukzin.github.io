								<h2>Formative Activities: Unit 3 </h2>
								<p>This activity is based on the questions from Tutor Oliver Buckley Unit 3 of the module: Software Development Life Cycles. Email sent 22 August 2024</p>
								It examines the role played by software development life cycles (SDLC) in influencing the way in which a project is managed, 
								considering, more specifically, the waterfall and agile approaches to project management.

										<h3 class="major">RESPONSE: Design, develop and evaluate management systems</h3>
										<p>Design, develop and evaluate management systems to produce solutions that handle constraints and uncertainty, contextualising BDD concepts and secure coding principles & practices in SDLC.</p>
										<p>The task of designing, developing and evaluating management systems that produce solutions that can handle constraints and uncertainty in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) involves a much 
											deeper understanding of project management principles. This includes understanding software development and coding practices to ensure that the software produced functions and is secure. 
											It means applying a robust Behaviour-Driven Development within an environment. Although this might be complex it’s doable.</p>
										<p><strong>Design Phases</strong></p>
										<p>The design of this kind of management system that will be able to handle constraints, and uncertainty starts with an understanding of the entire project scope including requirements. This phase is 
										critical as it’s setting the foundation for evolving requirements and how to approach constraints such as</p>
										<ul>
										<li>Limited time</li>
										<li>Budget and</li>
										<li>Resources</li>
										</ul>
										<p>This is a key element in developing a robust risk management plan, which identifies potential risks early in the project and devises strategies to mitigate them (Stellman & Greene, 2008).</p>
										<p><strong>Behaviour-Driven Management(BDD)</strong> at this phase is also essential</p>
										<ul>
											<li>It ensures that all stakeholders are involved early in the process</li>
											<li>It verifies that the requirements are clearly understood and agreed upon</li>
											<li>It can confirm understanding by using natural language descriptions to help reduce any ambiguity </li>
											<li>It guarantees that the team share an understanding of the goals</li>											
										</ul>
										<p>This shared understanding is crucial for managing constraints and uncertainty, ensuring everyone is aligned.</p>
										<p><strong>Development Phase</strong>
										<p>During development the design management system is implemented, with BDD and secure coding practices playing pivotal roles. BDD emphasizes collaboration between developers, testers, and non-technical 
										stakeholders using examples to guide development. This approach helps in continuously validating that the software meets the desired requirements, thus managing uncertainty and ensuring that constraints 
										are respected (University of Essex, 2024, 06:30).</p>
										<p>Secure coding principles should be integrated throughout the SDLC to prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced into the system. This involves adopting coding practices that are aligned with the industry 
											standards, conducting code reviews, and using automated tools to detect security flaws early in the development process. The integration of secure coding into the management system ensures that security 
											is not an afterthought but a continuous focus throughout the project (Stellman & Greene, 2008).</p>
										<p><strong>Evaluation Phase</strong>
											<p>Evaluating the management system involves assessing how well it handles the identified constraints and uncertainty. This can be done through regular reviews and testing, ensuring that the system adapts 
											to any changes in requirements or project scope. The effectiveness of BDD can be evaluated by examining how well it facilitated communication between stakeholders and how it contributed to the early 
											detection of issues. Similarly, the success of secure coding practices can be assessed by the absence of security vulnerabilities in the final product (University of Essex, 2024, 06:30).</p>
										<p>In conclusion, designing, developing, and evaluating management systems within the SDLC requires a careful balance of project management practices, collaborative development approaches like BDD, and rigorous 
											application of secure coding principles. By integrating these elements, you can create a system that not only meets its functional requirements but does so within the constraints of time, budget, and resources 
											while effectively managing the uncertainties inherent in software development.</p>
