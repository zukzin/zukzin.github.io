										<h3 class="major">Unit 2 Seminar: Scrum Security Review</h3>
										<p>Question 1:</p>
										<p>Create a 2-column multi-line table. In the left-hand column, include the software development stages of the Scrum agile life cycle approach to project management. 
										In the right-hand column, describe the processes which you recommend are applied at each stage to ensure that secure software is produced at the end of the development. 
										To support the preparation of your response, you can refer to the following literature:</p>

												<tbody>
													<tr>
														<td>Pre-requirement (Initial Planning)</td>
														<td>Initiate initial security education for all stakeholders to raise awareness of secure practices and define initial security requirements.

													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>Requirement (Requirement Gathering and Analysis)</td>

													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>Design (System and Architecture Design)</td>

														<td>Release (Deployment and Operational Readiness)</td>
														<td>Finalize security with operational planning and readiness to ensure proper documentation, code signing to validate integrity, and prepare

										<p>Question 2:</p>
										<p>Some say that people are the biggest risk of cyber security. Select five terms from ISO/IEC Standard 27000 Section 3 Terms and Definitions 
										and write a 300-word blog post on how people can be managed to overcome cyber security attacks from the inside.</p> 
										
										<p><b>Managing People to Overcome Insider Cybersecurity Threats</b></p>
										<p>Cybersecurity risks often emerge from within organizations due to human actions or errors, whether intentional or accidental. The five key terms identified from ISO/IEC 27000's Section 3 are; access control, authentication, confidentiality, risk management, and vulnerability which provide a framework for understanding and managing these risks (ISO/IEC, 2018).</p>
										
										<ol>
										<li>Access control (ISO/IEC, 2018, 3.1)</li>
										<p>Ensures that access to sensitive assets is restricted based on business needs and security requirements. I order to mitigate insider threats, organizations must implement stringent access control policies, limiting data access strictly to authorised personnel. Regular audits can further ensure adherence to these controls, helping maintain organizational security (ISO/IEC, 2018, 3.3).</p>

										<li>Authentication (ISO/IEC, 2018, 3.5)</li>
										<p>This is the process of verifying an individual’s claimed identity, forming a critical barrier against unauthorised access. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) reinforces this measure by requiring additional verification steps, making unauthorised access more challenging and helping prevent internal breaches.</p>

										<li>Confidentiality (ISO/IEC, 2018, 3.10)</li>
										<p>This involves safeguarding information from disclosure to unauthorised parties. Organizations should foster a culture of confidentiality by training employees on data sensitivity and the importance of secure information handling practices. Employees should be aware of potential consequences if confidentiality is compromised, thereby ensuring a safer information environment.</p>
										
										<li>Risk management (ISO/IEC, 2018, 3.69)</li>
										<p>The process coordinates organizational efforts to identify, analyse, and control risks. This means employees are integral to this process; through training, they become aware of common cyber threats and internal policies, enabling them to recognise and respond appropriately to potential incidents.</p>
										
										<li>Vulnerability (ISO/IEC, 2018, 3.77)</li>
										<p>Were weaknesses in assets or controls may present exploitable opportunities for threats. By promoting a proactive approach to identifying vulnerabilities, organizations can engage employees in early detection and reporting. This collaborative vigilance helps to address weaknesses before external actors can exploit them.</p>
										</ol>
										
										<p>Managing people effectively through awareness, access limitations, and clear confidentiality practices can significantly reduce cybersecurity risks from within. An informed and accountable workforce enhances an organization’s resilience against both internal and external threats.</p>
