										<h3 class="major">Unit 5: Exploring the Cyclomatic Complexity’s Relevance Today</h3>
										
										 <p>The Cyclomatic Complexity is commonly considered in modules on testing the validity of code design today. However, in your opinion, 
										should it be? Does it remain relevant today? Specific to the focus of this module, is it relevant in our quest to develop secure 
										software? </p>

										<p>Cyclomatic Complexity, introduced by Thomas J. McCabe in 1976, measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program’s 
										source code (McCabe, 1976; GeeksforGeeks, n.d.). Historically, it has been a key metric in the software testing domain to estimate test 
										coverage, maintainability, and code quality. Although software development paradigms and technologies have evolved substantially since 
										its inception, Cyclomatic Complexity still holds relevance in understanding code complexity, maintainability, and potential fault-proneness (GeeksforGeeks, n.d.). 
										However, its application and emphasis may warrant reconsideration in the context of modern secure software design.</p>

										<p>In terms of Maintainability and Readability today, a high Cyclomatic Complexity often correlates with more intricate control flows, making the code harder to read 
										or maintain (GeeksforGeeks, n.d.). In a contemporary development environment—where rapid iteration, continuous integration, and frequent code reviews are standard 
										practices—maintainability remains a critical concern. Code with high complexity can impede developers’ ability to quickly understand and modify software, often leading 
										to defects or vulnerabilities introduced through misunderstanding or insufficient testing (McCabe, 1976).</p>

										<p>When it comes to testing efficiency Cyclomatic Complexity still provides a baseline for identifying the minimum number of tests needed for full branch coverage, making 
										it a useful heuristic in test strategy (GeeksforGeeks, n.d.). Given the agile and DevOps cultures prevalent in modern software engineering, comprehensive testing is vital. 
										A high Cyclomatic Complexity suggests more test cases are required to cover all possible paths, emphasising the importance of adequate automated tests to mitCritics argue that 
										Cyclomatic Complexity does not account for complexities arising from modern paradigms, such as concurrency, distributed systems, and microservices (Pressman & Maxim, 2020). Simply measuring the 
										branching complexity of a single module may not capture the systemic risks in highly integrated environments. Moreover, Cyclomatic Complexity does not directly measure the complexity introduced
										by dependencies, external services, or asynchronous flows common in modern cloud-native architectures (GeeksforGeeks, n.d.).igate regressions 
										and vulnerabilities (Myers et al., 2011).</p>

										<p><b>Relevance to SSD (Secure Software Development:</b></p>
										<p>When considering security, an overly complex code can obscure hidden pathways and make it easier for vulnerabilities to go undetected 
										(Howard & Lipner, 2006). Complexity may also deter thorough code reviews, as developers spend more time deciphering logic (McGraw, 2006). Therefore, while Cyclomatic Complexity alone is not a direct measure 
										of security, it can act as an early-warning indicator—excessive complexity might correlate with an increased risk of logic errors, buffer overflows, or injection flaws that malicious actors 
										could exploit.</p>

										<p>Secure coding guidelines emphasize minimizing complexity to reduce the probability of introducing security-related defects (Seacord, 2013). By maintaining a lower Cyclomatic Complexity, development teams can more 
										effectively apply secure coding rules and systematically verify them. As such, Cyclomatic Complexity still plays a supportive role in shaping secure coding practices, even if it should not be the sole metric 
										used to gauge software security (OWASP, 2023)</p>

										<p>In the quest to develop secure software, Cyclomatic Complexity should be considered alongside other metrics such as code coverage, static analysis findings, and design-level threat modelling (Howard & Lipner, 2006; McGraw, 2006). 
										This multi-pronged approach better evaluates the overall security posture. Cyclomatic Complexity remains relevant insofar as it contributes to controlling and maintaining manageable complexity, which in turn supports a secure and 
										robust codebase.</p>

										<p>Conclusion</p>
										<p>Cyclomatic Complexity remains a pertinent measure in modern software engineering for understanding maintainability and guiding testing practices (GeeksforGeeks, n.d.; McCabe, 1976). While it may not capture all 
										facets of modern architectures—particularly those involving concurrency, distributed services, and complex integrations, it still provides a foundational perspective on code structure. In the context of secure 
										software development. Alone is not sufficient to ensure security, however, as part of a holistic set of metrics and practices, it offers tangible benefits in detecting areas of the code that might benefit 
										from additional scrutiny. Therefore it continues to be relevant and should be retained in modules that emphasise both code design validity and secure software development, although as one component of a comprehensive 
										quality and security assurance process (Howard & Lipner, 2006; McGraw, 2006).
