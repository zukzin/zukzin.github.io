										 <p>You should read Chapters 2,6,7,8 of the course text (Pillai, 2017) and Cifuentes & Bierman (2019) and then answer the questions below, adding them as evidence to your e-portfolio.</p>
										<ol>
										<li>What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</li>
										<li>Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.</li>
										<li>Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><b>Team component</b></p>
											<p>To address the question regarding factors that determine the security of a programming language, we must examine several key considerations: memory safety, input validation, and control over 
											data integrity, availability, and confidentiality. Languages that lack intrinsic support for these controls expose programs to vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, injection attacks, 
											and unauthorized data access (Cifuentes & Bierman, 2019). Security-conscious programming languages often integrate features designed to prevent common vulnerabilities by enforcing memory 
											boundaries and including strong type systems that reduce coding errors susceptible to exploitation. The most secure languages provide mechanisms like input sanitization, secure data handling 
											practices, and intrinsic memory protection, which collectively limit attack vectors like buffer overflows and injection attacks (Cifuentes & Bierman, 2019)​.</p>

											<p>Python’s design contributes significantly to writing secure applications. Its strong memory management system prevents direct memory access, thus mitigating risks associated with buffer overflow 
											errors commonly found in languages like C and C++ (Pillai, 2017). Moreover, Python’s robust standard library includes modules that enable secure handling of web input, cryptographic operations, 
											and input validation, enhancing its security in web applications and data-driven environments (Pillai, 2017)​(AnandBalachandr_2017_Ch…). Nevertheless, Python is not entirely without risks; for 
											instance, insecure practices such as evaluating arbitrary input or poor exception handling can open up vulnerabilities if not managed carefully (Pillai, 2017).</p>

											<p>In contrast, C, due to its low-level operations and direct memory manipulation capabilities, has fewer intrinsic safeguards against memory-related vulnerabilities, which makes it more prone to buffer 
											overflows and memory allocation errors. However, C is often preferred for system-level programming due to its control over hardware resources and high performance. From a security standpoint, 
											while C offers flexibility, this comes at the cost of increased responsibility on the developer to mitigate security risks through rigorous testing and external security controls 
											(Cifuentes & Bierman, 2019)​.</p>

											<p>The question of whether Python is better suited than C for creating operating systems involves several considerations. C provides high-performance execution and efficient memory management—critical 
											factors in OS development—qualities where Python is generally less efficient due to its interpreted nature and garbage collection overhead. Operating systems require low-latency operations and 
											precise resource control, areas where Python’s higher-level abstractions and slower execution can be a drawback (Pillai, 2017). While Python is beneficial for rapid prototyping, its lack of 
											native support for low-level memory and process control makes it less suitable for full-scale OS development (Pillai, 2017)​.</p>

											<p>In summary, while Python is a relatively secure language with features that protect against certain vulnerabilities, its suitability as an OS development language is limited by performance constraints. 
											C, although less inherently secure, remains preferred for system programming due to its control and efficiency.</p>
