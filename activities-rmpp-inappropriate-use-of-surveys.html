										<h3 class="major">Unit 5: Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys</h3>
										
										 <p>In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore, 2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained 
										from millions of Facebook users. They obtained the data through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably 
										participated at times). This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. 
										However, this happens often through various media.</p>
										
										<p>Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the 
										impact of all these examples from the various ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.</p>

										<p><strong>How this happened</strong></p>
										<p>Cambridge Analytica harvested data from millions of Facebook users through a seemingly harmless personality quiz, exploiting Facebook’s lax privacy 
										policies. The company used this data to create psychographic profiles to target individuals with political content, particularly during the Brexit referendum 
										and the 2016 U.S. presidential election (Confessore, 2018; Amnesty International, 2019). Amnesty International (2019) criticised the practice as a serious 
										breach of human rights, arguing that it undermines the rights to privacy, freedom of opinion, and democratic participation.</p>

										<p>Ethical Concerns</p>
										<p>Participants were not adequately informed about the scope of data being collected and how it would be used, violating principles of informed consent and autonomy.</p>
										<p>Social standpoint</p>
										<p>Such misuse of surveys erodes public trust in online platforms and academic research. Individuals become more reluctant to participate in surveys or share personal information, 
										fearing misuse. This has long-term consequences for legitimate research efforts and public engagement with science and governance.</p>
										<p>Professional standpoint</p>
										<p>Professionals are bound by codes of conduct that emphasise integrity, transparency and respect for privacy. The involvement of an academic in the initial data gathering 
										process—using research tools under the guise of scientific inquiry raises questions about research ethics and professional accountability in both academia and the industry.</p>
										
										<p>While surveys remain valuable tools for collecting information, their misuse as demonstrated by Cambridge Analytica and similar cases can have far-reaching ethical, social, legal 
										and professional implications. These cases underscore the need for stricter regulation, greater transparency and stronger ethical standards to safeguard individuals’ data and maintain public trust.</p>

										<p><strong>TikTok Personality Quizzes and Data Harvesting (2020–2021)</strong></p>
										<p>In recent years, several viral personality quizzes and survey-style features on TikTok and other social media platforms were found to be collecting user data under misleading pretences. Users, particularly 
										younger audiences, were encouraged to take part in interactive quizzes that seemed light-hearted and fun (e.g., "What kind of pasta are you?" or "Which celebrity matches your personality?"). However, many of 
										these apps or third-party integrations requested extensive access to personal data such as location, device information and browsing behaviour. Some shared it with advertisers or data brokers.</p>

										<p><strong>Royal Free London NHS Trust and Google DeepMind Data Sharing Scandal (2016)</strong></p>
										<p>In 2016, the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust partnered with Google’s DeepMind to develop a healthcare app called Streams, designed to help detect acute kidney injury. To develop this app, 
										the NHS Trust provided DeepMind with access to the personal medical records of approximately 1.6 million patients without informing those patients or obtaining their consent. 
										Although no traditional survey was used, the data were collected under the assumption of routine care, and then used in a way patients were not made aware of, raising major concerns about the 
										secondary use of sensitive data.</p>
