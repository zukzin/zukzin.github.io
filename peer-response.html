									<h3 class="major">Peer Response 1: Software Engineering and Project Management</h3>
									<p>by Oi Lam Siu  - Wednesday, 7 August 2024, 9:30 AM </p>

									<p>Hello Zukiswa,</p>
									<p>Your insights into CRM software project failures are both detailed and enlightening. Your first-hand examples vividly illustrate the complexities and challenges faced during such implementations.</p>
									<p> The Avon case you mentioned highlights the significant impact of user adoption issues, underscoring the importance of user-friendly systems. Similarly, your experience with sales staff resistance to change is a common hurdle many organizations encounter.</p>
									<p>I also have a similar case. I remember when I started working at current company, I was informed that my role would replace the Finance Manager. She planned to retire early because she lacked confidence in learning the new ERP system and processes.</p>
									<p>It's clear that a lack of proper planning and organization often leads to project failure. Emphasizing the need to break projects into smaller, manageable components is crucial. This approach not only helps in managing expectations but also ensures that each phase is clearly understood and executed.</p>
									<p>In conclusion, your experiences and examples provide valuable lessons for anyone involved in software project management. Addressing scheduling issues, fostering cooperation, and focusing on realistic estimations are key strategies that can significantly improve the chances of project success. Your post serves as a practical guide for navigating the complexities of CRM implementations, and your insights are beneficial for both IT and non-IT professionals alike.</p>
									<p> Best regards, Helen</p>

									<p> Hi Zukiswa,</p>
									<p> Your post provides valuable insights drawn from your real-world experiences with CRM software implementations. Your perspective as someone who has worked closely with these projects, despite not being in IT, adds a unique dimension to your analysis. Here are some observations and suggestions to further enhance your discussion:</p>
									<p>1. Real-World Experience:</p>
									<p>Your inclusion of personal experiences from various organizations adds significant value to your analysis. It would be beneficial to expand on these experiences with more specific details about the projects, such as the size of the teams involved, the complexity of the CRM systems, and the organizational context. These details can help others better understand the challenges faced and the lessons learned.</p>
									<p>2. Organization and Planning-Related Failures:</p>
									<p>Youâ€™ve identified key issues such as unrealistic scheduling and the challenges of implementing significant changes all at once. To strengthen this section, you could explore how project management methodologies like Agile or Waterfall could address these issues. For example, Agile's iterative approach might mitigate the risks associated with implementing large-scale changes all at once.</p>
									<p>3. Managing the Project-Related Failures:</p>
									<p>The emphasis on communication and collaboration is crucial, especially in large projects. It might be useful to discuss specific strategies or tools that can improve collaboration among team members and stakeholders. For example, how can project management software or regular stand-up meetings help in maintaining alignment and preventing misunderstandings?</p>
									<p>4. Estimation-Related Failures:</p>
									<p>Your points about time and cost estimation are well taken. To add depth to your analysis, consider discussing estimation techniques such as Function Point Analysis (FPA) or Planning Poker, which can help improve the accuracy of time and cost estimates. You might also explore the impact of these estimation failures on the broader project scope and deliverables.</p>
									<p>5. User Adoption Challenges:</p>
									<p>The example of the sales staff member resigning due to the CRM migration highlights the critical issue of user adoption. This is a common challenge in software projects, and it might be helpful to delve deeper into strategies for managing change and encouraging user adoption. For instance, how could better training programs or involving users early in the project have mitigated these issues?</p>
									<p>6. Examples and Case Studies:</p>
									<p>The examples you provided, particularly the Avon and FAA projects, are highly relevant. You might consider including more details on how these projects could have been better managed, perhaps by comparing them with similar successful projects. This could provide a more balanced view and offer concrete takeaways for improving project outcomes.</p>
									<p>Overall, your post effectively combines personal experience with broader project management principles. By expanding on some of these points and integrating more detailed analysis and theoretical insights, you could further enhance the depth and relevance of your discussion. Your unique perspective is a strong asset, and with some additional refinement, your analysis could be even more impactful.</p>

									<p>by Anda Ziemele - Saturday, 10 August 2024, 10:23 PM</p>
									<p>Dear Zukiswa</p>
									<p>Thank you for your valuable entry to this discussion. You have effectively covered the some of the most common examples to software engineering project failures, including providing relevant examples. I particularly enjoyed how you drew examples from your professional experience and connected these back to known major failures in the industry. Your post particularly highlights the different kinds of failures a project might experience. It may be delivered successfully, on-time, with all requirements seemingly met, however, if user adoption is not achieved, the project has ultimately failed. Although the example not directly relevant, Douthwaite et al. (2001) highlight the importance of key stakeholders to participate in innovation development early, especially as complexity increases, and maximising the completeness of the first release as much as possible to foster a continuous, successful adoption process.</p>
									<p>An additional build on your discussion that I would consider and explore further is the role of effective leadership in facilitating adoption, and ultimately the success of software engineering projects. For example, Ali et al. (2020) demonstrate that humble leadership traits encourage psychological empowerment and innovative work behaviours in employees, which ultimately contribute to a successful outcome. It is worth exploring how effective leadership including its associated traits can lead to both failures and successes.</p>
